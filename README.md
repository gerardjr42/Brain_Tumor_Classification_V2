# Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning

## 🌐 Visit the Live Project
[Brain Tumor Classification App](https://braintumorclassificationv2.streamlit.app/)

## 📝 Note About Test Images
Before you begin exploring the application, I've provided a collection of MRI brain scan images in the `images` folder of this repository. Feel free to download and use these images to test the classification system. These images have been carefully selected to demonstrate the model's capabilities across different types of brain tumors.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based system for automated brain tumor classification from MRI scans. The system can classify brain tumors into four categories:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

## 🎯 Purpose and Importance
Brain tumor diagnosis is a critical and time-sensitive process in medical care. This project aims to:
- Assist medical professionals in making faster, more accurate preliminary assessments
- Provide a second opinion tool for radiologists
- Reduce the time needed for initial tumor detection and classification
- Make advanced tumor detection technology more accessible to healthcare facilities worldwide

## 🔬 Key Features
- Real-time MRI scan classification
- Advanced saliency mapping to visualize model focus areas
- Detailed probability distribution for each tumor type
- Expert-level explanations of results using Google's Gemini AI
- Support for multiple deep learning models (Xception and Custom CNN)

## 💡 Why It Matters
Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is crucial for:
- Improving patient survival rates
- Enabling earlier treatment interventions
- Reducing diagnostic costs
- Supporting healthcare providers in regions with limited access to specialist radiologists

## 🚀 Try It Yourself
1. Visit [site](https://braintumorclassificationv2.streamlit.app/)
2. Upload an MRI scan image (you can use samples from the `images` folder)
3. Choose your preferred model
4. Get instant classification results with detailed visualizations and explanations

## 🔄 Ongoing Development
*I'm still continuing learning and trying to make the custom CNN model more accurate, specifically in the areas of the brain it focuses on. Stay tuned for more!*


## ⚠️ Important Note
This tool is designed to assist medical professionals and should not be used as the sole basis for medical decisions. Always consult qualified healthcare providers for proper diagnosis and treatment.
